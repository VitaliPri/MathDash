# [MathDash](https://mathdash.vercel.app/)
MathDash is a web application that allows users to play a math game. It consists of several pages, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Splash Page**: This is the initial page where users can select the number of math questions they want to answer. It contains a form with radio buttons for different question amounts.

2. **Countdown Page**: After selecting the number of questions, users are taken to a countdown page where they see a countdown from 3 to 1 and then "GO!" before the game starts.

3. **Game Page**: This is the main game page where users answer math questions. The page displays equations, and users have to select whether each equation is correct or incorrect. The page also has a timer that tracks how long it takes the user to answer all the questions.

4. **Score Page**: After completing the game, users are taken to a score page where they see their final time, base time (time taken to answer questions without penalties), and penalty time (time added for incorrect answers). The page also shows the best scores for different question amounts.

The project uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as selecting the number of questions, answering equations, and displaying scores. It also uses local storage to store and retrieve best scores.
